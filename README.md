<https://hub.docker.com/r/uport/uni-resolver-driver-did-uport/>

The file `expressresolver.js` is an small Express Node app acting as a thin wrapper around the [Javascript DID resolver](https://github.com/uport-project/did-resolver). It listens to port 8081.

The following DID methods are supported:

* [uPort](https://github.com/uport-project/uport-did-resolver)
* [ÂµPort](https://github.com/uport-project/muport-did-resolver)
* [ethr](https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-resolver)
* [eth](https://github.com/uport-project/eth-did-resolver)

The resolver currently uses the default Ethereum and IPFS nodes hosted by [Infura](https://infura.io).
